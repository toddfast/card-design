# Adobe Illustrator Tools for Game Card Design

The following repository helps you design game cards using Adobe Illustrator CC 2015, merge the design with data, and output individual card files as well as files ready to be cut on a Silhouette Curio.

## ExtendScript Toolkit

Use the ExtendScript Toolkit to edit and execute scripts more easily. Use of the toolkit is optional, as you can always execute scripts via the File > Scripts > Other Script... (Cmd-F12) command; it is just a bit more convenient.

One hint: When the Toolkit is attached to the running instance of Illustrator, there is a periodic pause when editing scripts in the Toolkit. You may instead detach the Toolkit until you are ready to run the script by clicking the green "link" icon in the upper left of the main Toolkit document window.
